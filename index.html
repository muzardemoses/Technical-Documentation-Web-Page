                Oil is produced (extracted) using different methods depending on
                geology and location. After recovering the oil, it is sent to
                refineries to create refined products we use every day, such as
                gasoline.

                The first efforts to tap the oil sands resource began in the
                <a href="https://www.capp.ca/oil/history-of-oil/">
                  mid 20th century</a

                using hot water to separate bitumen from sand. Since then the
                process has evolved into the sophisticated methods we use to
                extract oil today.

        <article>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.capp.ca/oil/">Oil</a> is a black, brownish or
            amber liquid. A complex mix of hydrocarbons including carbon,
            hydrogen, sulphur, nitrogen, oxygen and metals, oil formed millions
            of years ago from animal and plant remains deposited in sand and
            silt, and pressurized by layers of sedimentary rock.
          </p>

          <p>
            Oil is classified as light, medium, heavy or extra heavy. Light and
            medium oil can flow naturally to the earth’s surface and is
            generally extracted from the ground using vertical drilling and
            pumping – this includes Canada’s offshore oil. Some light oil is
            trapped in “tight” (non-porous) rock formations, usually shale. This
            “light tight oil” can be recovered using horizontal drilling and
            hydraulic fracturing. Heavy oil has a thick consistency that does
            not flow easily, often requiring advanced technology to extract.

          <p>
            Conventional oil is extracted from underground reservoirs using
            traditional drilling and pumping methods. Conventional oil is a
            liquid at atmospheric temperature and pressure, so it can flow
            through a wellbore and a pipeline – unlike bitumen (oil sands oil)
            which is too thick to flow without being heated or diluted. It’s
            easier and less expensive to recover conventional oil and it
            requires less processing after extraction. Conventional oil
            development is both land-based and offshore.

        <header>Unconventional Oil</header>
        <article>
          Unconventional oil cannot be recovered using conventional drilling and pumping methods. Advanced extraction techniques, such as oil sands mining and in situ development, are used to recover heavier oil that does not flow on its own. Oil found in geological formations that make it more difficult to extract, such as light tight oil (LTO), is also called unconventional oil because non-traditional techniques are needed to extract the oil from the underground reservoir.

        <header>Surface Mining</header>
        <p>
          Oil recovery in the oil sands uses two main methods: mining or in situ, depending on how deep the oil sands deposits are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surface mining is used when oil sands deposits lie within 70 meters (200 feet) of the earth’s surface. Twenty per cent of oil sands reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined. Large shovels scoop oil sand into haul trucks that <a href="https://www.capp.ca/energy/transportation/">transport</a> it to crushers where large clumps are broken down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oil sand is then mixed with hot water and pumped by pipeline to a plant called an upgrader, where the bitumen (oil) is separated from the other components such as sand, clay and water.

        <article>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.capp.ca/explore/tailings-ponds/">Tailings ponds</a> are common in all types of surface mining around the world. In the oil sands, tailings – consisting of water, sand, clay and trace amounts of oil – are pumped to ponds where the sand and clay gradually settle to the bottom. Water near the top is reused in the mining and bitumen separation process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a tailings pond is no longer needed, it is <a href="https://www.capp.ca/explore/land-reclamation/">reclaimed</a>. Oil sands companies that have mining operations are researching many techniques to solidify the tailings faster so the ponds can be dried out, re-surfaced with soil, and planted with local tree and shrub species.

        <article>
          <p>
            Extracting oil from Canada’s offshore is a unique process compared to onshore oil extraction. Initially, companies may begin their exploration process by reviewing existing geological and geophysical data to learn more about potential reservoirs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, <a href="https://atlanticcanadaoffshore.ca/marine-seismic-surveys/">seismic surveys</a> are completed to map geological structures under the seabed. If an analysis of seismic data shows a geological structure that could contain oil and natural gas resources, a company may decide to drill an exploration well. as Precise information is needed before investing in drilling an exploratory well given because of the high cost of drilling in the offshore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before drilling and offshore oil extraction can begin, companies must apply for the appropriate approvals from the relevant <a href="https://atlanticcanadaoffshore.ca/regulation/">regulatory body</a> in Atlantic Canada.
